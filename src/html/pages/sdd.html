                            I worked in a team of three to functionally and aesthetically develop the website for an edtech startup.
                            The backend was run via Knorish, which supported HTML, CSS and basic JavaScript.
                            My roles included UI/UX Design, Software Development, Design System creation and vector illustration.

                            Later, I was offered the role of leading the Technology and Product Development Team, where
                            my tasks included expanding the team, developing a monthly newsletter automated by Sendinblue and
                            website maintenance.
